# Data Structures & Algorithms With Golang 101

![Build Status](https://github.com/LucasKonrath/algos-data-structures-go/actions/workflows/go.yml/badge.svg)

This repository is dedicated to studying and practicing the concepts from the book **Data Structures & Algorithms With Golang 101 (English Edition)** by Aarav Joshi. It contains Go implementations of the data structures and algorithms presented in the book, along with unit tests and example usages.

## Structure

- Each data structure and algorithm is implemented in its own package/folder.
- Unit tests are provided for most implementations to help you verify correctness and deepen your understanding.
- The code is organized for easy navigation and experimentation.

## Purpose

The goal of this repository is to:
- Reinforce learning by implementing examples from the book.
- Serve as a reference for Go-based data structures and algorithms.
- Provide a foundation for further study and interview preparation.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone <repo-url>
   ```
2. Run tests for any package:
   ```sh
   go test ./...
   ```
3. Explore and modify the code to experiment with different data structures and algorithms.
